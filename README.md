Project Description

We created a web page where users can customize their own avatars and fetch (randomly) their own Pokemon. Then, users are able to merge their avatar with elements of the chosen Pokemon to create a new image. Users can also save the image of their own customized avatar and also the merged image. We chose this project because we wanted to make something that is fun and interesting for users to interact with.

Functionality
There are 5 separate steps in our project, each with a different functionality.

1. Basic customization of the avatar - change the avatar's skin color, hair color and/or clothes color
2. More advanced customization of the avatar, using a drag and drop - change the avatar's facial expressions, facial features, and/or head accessories
3. Download and save the avatar the user has created
4. Fetch a random pokemon, using the Pokemon API - users will be shown the Pokemon name, type and image. Each click of the button fetches a different random Pokemon.
5. Using machine learning techniques, merge the customized Avatar with the randomly chosen Pokemon into one single image.
Download the merged image.
